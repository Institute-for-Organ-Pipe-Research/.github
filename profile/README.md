# Institute for Organ Pipe Research

## General Objective of the Project
The project aims to create a comprehensive platform for the inventory and documentation of pipe organs. This database will serve as a tool for collecting, storing, and analyzing information about these instruments, with a particular focus on preserving and safeguarding historical organs for future generations.

The platform will be designed as an open and collaborative environment where professional organ builders, organists, and enthusiasts can actively contribute to expanding its resources. As a result, the database will encompass detailed documentation, including construction, acoustic, historical, and technical aspects, enabling effective conservation, reconstruction, and promotion of the pipe organ heritage.

## Detailed Scope of the Database
The database will include comprehensive information about the dimensions and characteristics of individual organ stops and their components. This will cover length, width, scaling ratios (mensuration), and additional construction features that influence the tonal quality of each organ stop.

Additionally, the inventory will provide detailed measurements of organ cases, wind chests, and supporting structures. For each instrument, both required information and optional, dynamically structured data will be available, adapting to the level of detail provided in the inventory description.

This flexible approach will ensure that the database can accommodate a wide range of documentation, from basic information to highly detailed descriptions, meeting the needs of researchers, organ builders, and enthusiasts alike.

## Data Utilization
Since the project involves detailed inventorying of pipe organs, the collected data can be widely applied in various fields. Acousticians will be able to use it for acoustic analyses and studying the sound properties of organs, while software engineers can develop tools for digital documentation and organ simulation.

The project also aims to create software that is not necessarily directly related to organs but will provide innovative solutions for their digitalization. The database will serve as a key resource for supporting pipe organ sound synthesis based on physical modeling. As part of a community-driven initiative, the project will facilitate the development of open-source software, enabling accurate reproduction of organ sounds and further digital reconstruction of these instruments.

## Currently Developed Software:

### GrandBridge

GrandBridge is a software component of the pipe organ digitalization project. Its main purpose is to create a communication bridge between traditional pipe organs and modern digital technologies. The software will allow for controlling real organs as well as integrating with digital organ models.

GrandBridge will also support sound synthesis based on the data stored in the database, enabling the reproduction of organ sounds both in the physical and digital environments. With its flexibility and advanced features, the software will be capable of working with a wide range of devices, creating a platform for the digitalization and conservation of pipe organs.
